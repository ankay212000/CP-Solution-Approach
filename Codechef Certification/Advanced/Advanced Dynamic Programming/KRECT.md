# Problem
Given a M\*N square board. Each square contains a letter of the English alphabet ('A' .. 'Z').

A K-rectangle of the board is a rectangle whose sides are parallel to the sides of the board, and contains exactly K different types of letter.

For example, with this 4\*3 board:

    CED
    CEB
    CBC
    DDA

The rectangle \[(1,1), (2,2)\] is a 2-rectangle of the board because it contains 2 different letters: C and E.

Given M, N, K and the M\*N board. Determine how many K-rectangles there are in the board.

### Input
The first line contains 3 integers M, N and K. (1 ≤ M, N ≤ 100, 1 ≤ K ≤ 26)

The following M lines, each contains N letters of the English alphabet ('A' .. 'Z')

### Output
Write one integer - the number of K-rectangles in the given board.

### Example
>Input:<br/>
4 3 3<br/>
CED<br/>
CEB<br/>
CBC<br/>
DDA<br/>

>Output:<br/>
12<br/>
