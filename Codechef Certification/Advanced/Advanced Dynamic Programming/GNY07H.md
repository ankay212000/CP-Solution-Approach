# Problem
We wish to tile a grid 4 units high and _**N**_ units long with rectangles (dominoes) 2 units by one unit (in either orientation). For example, the figure shows the five different ways that a grid 4 units high and 2 units wide may be tiled.

Write a program that takes as input the width, _**W**_, of the grid and outputs the number of different ways to tile a 4-by-_**W**_ grid.

### Input
The first line of input contains a single integer _**N**_, (1 ≤ _**N**_ ≤ 1000) which is the number of datasets that follow.

Each dataset contains a single decimal integer, the width, _**W**_, of the grid for this problem instance.

### Output
For each problem instance, there is one line of output: The problem instance number as a decimal integer (start counting at one), a single space and the number of tilings of a 4-by-_**W**_ grid. The values of _**W**_ will be chosen so the count will fit in a 32-bit integer.

### Example
>Input:<br/>
3<br/>
2<br/>
3<br/>
7<br/>

>Output:<br/>
1 5<br/>
2 11<br/>
3 781<br/>
